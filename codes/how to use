I can see from the screenshot that your file system simulator is running. You're currently at the root directory of your simulated file system as indicated by the prompt "fs:/>".

## How to Use Your File System Simulator

Here's how to use the commands you've implemented:

### Basic Commands

1. **touch** - Create a new file
   ```
   touch filename.txt 1024
   ```
   This creates a file named "filename.txt" with a size of 1024 bytes.

2. **rm** - Remove a file
   ```
   rm filename.txt
   ```

3. **mkdir** - Create a new directory
   ```
   mkdir documents
   ```

4. **rmdir** - Remove a directory (must be empty)
   ```
   rmdir documents
   ```

5. **cd** - Change directory
   ```
   cd documents
   cd ..        (go up one level)
   cd /         (go to root)
   ```

6. **ls** - List directory contents
   ```
   ls
   ls documents
   ```

7. **cp** - Copy a file
   ```
   cp source.txt destination.txt
   ```

8. **cat** - Display file contents
   ```
   cat filename.txt
   ```

9. **sum** - Show file system usage summary
   ```
   sum
   ```

10. **exit** - Exit the file system simulator
    ```
    exit
    ```

### Example Usage Sequence

```
mkdir documents
mkdir images
touch hello.txt 512
ls
cd documents
touch report.txt 1024
ls
cd ..
cp hello.txt documents/hello_copy.txt
ls documents
cat documents/report.txt
sum
```

The simulator appears to be working correctly based on the prompt shown in your screenshot. Try using some of these commands to verify that all functionality is working as expected.
